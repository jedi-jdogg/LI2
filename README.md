# Running the React Frontend in the Client Directory

To run the React frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Interaction with the Backend

The React frontend interacts with the backend via HTTP requests. Ensure that the backend server is running, and make sure to configure the API endpoints correctly in the frontend to match those of the backend. This allows the frontend to retrieve and send data as needed.
